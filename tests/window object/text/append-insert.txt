(1) appendChild(): this is a method to append aalrady created new element to the document.
        if we append it to an existing element then this will appended at last index of that element
        but  if we append it to document then it will be added just before end of body tag.
        the syntax is:
                element.appendChild(newElement)

(1) insertBefore(): this is a method to append alrady created new element to the specific place
        like before any element.
        the syntax is:
                element.insertBefore(newElement, targetElement);
        here we have to give two arguments: 
        1. new element which we want to insert.
        2. target element before we want our new element to be inserted.
